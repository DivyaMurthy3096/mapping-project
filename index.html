 <h1> Hoping to kill NYC's rat problem? You might be looking in the wrong place. </h1>

<p> A vocal group of New Yorkers <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2022/07/31/outdoor-structures-blamed-for-noise--trash--and-rodents"> filed a lawsuit</a> earlier this year against outdoor restaurants, complaining about rodents, rats and garbage littering their blocks. It seemed particularly alarming when juxtaposed with the discovery that rat sightings are up by 35% since the beginning of 2020. </p>

<p> “These deserted sheds have become havens for rats,” said Mayor Adams in Time Out magazine, <a href="https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/nyc-is-dismantling-abandoned-outdoor-dining-sheds-081822"> commenting</a> on the plan to remove outdoor sheds in August.</p>

<p> But city data reveals that though rat sightings skyrocketed in the city, most complaints are still being made by homes and residential buildings — so people may be pointing fingers at the wrong trend.</p>

<p> Buildings with three or more families living in them and dwellings with one or two families made the most reports between 2019 and 2020, from all boroughs.</p>

<p> Benett Pearlman, owner and founder of Positive Pest Management, a pest control company operating in New York for over 20 years, said it’s “ludicrous” to blame restaurants and that he “100 percent” disagrees with the people filing the lawsuit against outdoor dining sheds.</p>

<p> “Every night, the garbage bags go out, and the rats know that once it gets dark, and the traffic walking up and down the street slows down significantly, the bags come out and they start eating on them,” Bennett said. “What the hell would outdoor restaurants have anything to do with increasing or decreasing population?”</p>

<p> Between 2019 and 2020 — the only years in which data about rat sightings at restaurants, delis, bars and cafes exist — 17 complaints were made about rodent sightings at restaurants, cafes and delis. None were made from Queens.  In comparison, residential buildings made 26,808 complaints of rodent sightings in 2022 alone.</p>

<p> These maps below show the density of rat complaints made in total, and then of those made against restaurants, bars, delis and cafes.</p>

    <p> Pearlman believed that residential became the new commercial since the onset of the pandemic, as people retreated indoors and rats followed where the food now was. He also believed that the real fight should be taken up with the city’s government and Department of Health.</p>

    <p> “It was the city's duty to address a public health issue because let's face it, if you read up on what happened with the black plague, this is exactly how it happened,” he said. “The city has done zero to address this plague.”</p>

    <p> “Every agency in this city that has a pest control division is not doing their job, and they're not reporting back to newscasters when they ask for FOIA requests for ZIP codes that have the highest rate problems,” he added.</p>

    <p> Despite having one of the biggest budgets for cities, New York has failed in its mission to address a public health issue for many years, with differing effects across boroughs, in Pearlman’s opinion.</p>

  <p>“The poor and oppressed have always had severe rat issues—anybody in the outer boroughs...this is nothing new to them,” he said. “They are just laughing at the white people not having [it]. This has been a problem with them for decades, decades.”</p>
